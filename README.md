# Python-2nd-Semester-Project
This is my python project called smart transaction scanner , assigned to me as a semester project in my 2nd semester of Bachelors in AI . 
Smart Transaction Scanner is a beginner-friendly financial fraud detection and visualization app built using Python and Streamlit. This project allows users to upload a CSV file containing transaction data and automatically scans for potentially fraudulent transactions using simple rule-based logic.

# 🚀 Features
📂 CSV Upload: Upload your transaction dataset (CSV format)

⚙️ Preprocessing: Cleans data, converts time, extracts transaction hours

🧠 Fraud Detection Rules:

Flags transactions with amounts greater than 2000

Flags transactions occurring during unusual hours (before 6 AM or after 10 PM)

📊 Data Visualization Dashboard:

Histogram of transaction amounts

Bar chart of transactions by hour

Fraud risk summary with counts of flagged vs normal transactions

📥 Export Results: Download the labeled dataset as a new CSV file
